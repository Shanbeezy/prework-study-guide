# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who are going through the Prework. I created this webpage to act as a Study Guide to store all of the information that I learned in one place that would be easily accessible to me, as well as other students. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the Webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion of which topic to study first.
