      <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.
            </li>
            <li>The head element contains information (metadata), that helps the browser render the page ccorrectly.
              Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
              <li>The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Text elements</li>
                <li>Image elements</li>
                <li>Header elements</li>
                <li>List elements</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Meta-related elements</li>
                <li>Content division elements</li>
                <li>Semantic elements</li>
              </ol>
            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user
              to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it
              easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage</li>
        <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Inline CSS</b> - used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. These styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. These are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li><b>Internal CSS style sheet</b>- Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML. This makes it possible to embed the entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file. The rules would only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements to style multiple elements in that page's code. All changes to the CSS rule will apply to all the tagged page elements.</li>
            <li><b>External CSS style sheet</b>- This is the most common way to style a webpage because it allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using this method, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) - a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. Can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. (This includes effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.) </li>
        <li>A variable is named container that allows us to store data in our code. After declaring a variable, you can give it a value. (Note that variables may hold values that have different data types)</li>
        <ol>
          <li><b>String</b> - This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote markes</li>
          <li><b>Number</b> - This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li><b>Boolean</b> - This is a True/False value. The words <i>True</i> and <i>False</i> are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li><b>Array</b> - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li><b>Object</b> - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>An operator is a mathmatical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Addition - Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
          <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division - These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</li>
          <li>Assignment - This assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>Strict equality - This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a <i>True/False</i> (Boolean) result.</li>
          <li>Not, Does-not-equal - This returns a logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a <i>true</i> into a <i>false</i>, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator rests whether two values are <b><i>NOT</i></b> equal.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
        <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. (If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses, it's likely a function.) Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
        <li>A <i>For</i>loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement to interrpt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
        <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the growser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file; we can't just throw it all in there any which way!</li>
        <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just incase you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put (/*) before and (*/) after the block of code.</li>
