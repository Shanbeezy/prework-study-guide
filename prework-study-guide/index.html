      <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.
            </li>
            <li>The head element contains information (metadata), that helps the browser render the page ccorrectly.
              Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
              <li>The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Text elements</li>
                <li>Image elements</li>
                <li>Header elements</li>
                <li>List elements</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Meta-related elements</li>
                <li>Content division elements</li>
                <li>Semantic elements</li>
              </ol>
            <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user
              to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it
              easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage</li>
        <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Inline CSS</b> - used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. These styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. These are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            <li><b>Internal CSS style sheet</b>- Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML. This makes it possible to embed the entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file. The rules would only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements to style multiple elements in that page's code. All changes to the CSS rule will apply to all the tagged page elements.</li>
            <li><b>External CSS style sheet</b>- This is the most common way to style a webpage because it allows developers to keep all of their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When using this method, we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) - a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. Can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
      </ul>
